<h2>The Path to PBJ Perfection</h2>
    <p> How do we get these two cuties together? Follow these easy steps!<br> You'll need: two slices of bread, a knife, a jar of jelly, a jar of peanut butter, and a can-do attitude!
        <ol>
        <li>Use your knife to carefully slather jelly onto one side of one slice of your bread. Really go for it.</li>
            <li>Use your knife to slather a generous amount of peanut butter onto one side of your other slice of bread. Careful with your PB to J ratio here - no one likes a soggy sandwich.</li>
                <li>Gently and lovingly take your two slices of bread and put them together, being sure that the jelly and peanut butter are now joined in perfect harmony. </li>
   
            </ol>
            </p>
